## MauroBOT

Testing discord bot creation for the first time
It's purpose is just to understand discords bots functionality, learn rust a little better, and maybe make something useful for me and my friends (?)

### Functionality

- `invite`: create an invite link that works only for 10 minutes and is temporary (when the user logs out, it automatically kicked)
The only functionality atm is create temporary invite links for the discord with the command `invite`
- `random`: create a random int from the user input, takes 2 integers
- `lupus`: a group of commands (wip) to manage a lupus game
